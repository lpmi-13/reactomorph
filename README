# reactomorph

this is a very basic demo intended to grow into a more full-fledged micromaterial for EFL learners to easily find morphologically related words.

For example, words related to "specific" would be "specify", "specifically", "specifics", etc.

We can't find these in a thesaurus, or even a learners dictionary. This is hopefully an easy place to find those.

In terms of why we might want to find these, they can come in very handy in a summarization or paraphrasing task.

Often, students will need to paraphrase from source materials while writing academic papers, and using different word forms is one common way to do this.

eg, transform "The project was specifically interested in agriculture." into "Agriculture formed the specific focus of the project."

To that end, I'm hoping to add a component where students can either take a short quiz on different derivations, or even try some paraphrasing themselves...though I still don't have any ideas on how to actually implement that. PR's welcome!
